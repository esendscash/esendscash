There are many good reasons to get a loan. Unexpected expenses come up. People might find they have to plan and fund a wedding, refurbish their home or send a child to university. They might have to buy a new car or second home or they might want to start a small business. These events take money and not everyone has it at their fingertips. That's why a loan can be a good idea.

The type of loan you get will depend on your circumstances. People who want less than and who have a good credit rating can consider an unsecured loan. They can get one from banks and other lenders by filling in a form and waiting for their credit history to be assessed.
